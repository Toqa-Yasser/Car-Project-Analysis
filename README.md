# Car Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Š Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of cars, exploring various features to uncover insights into automotive trends, pricing, and performance metrics. The analysis aims to assist potential buyers in making informed decisions and provides valuable information for manufacturers and dealerships.

## ðŸš— Data Features
The dataset includes the following features:

- **Make:** The brand or manufacturer of the car.
- **Model:** The specific model or version of the car produced by the manufacturer.
- **Type:** The body type or classification of the car (e.g., sedan, SUV, truck, etc.).
- **Origin:** The country or region where the car was manufactured.
- **DriveTrain:** Configuration of the vehicle's drivetrain (FWD, RWD, AWD, 4WD).
- **MSRP:** Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price.
- **Invoice:** The invoice price, the amount paid by the dealer to the manufacturer.
- **EngineSize:** Size of the engine in liters.
- **Cylinders:** Number of cylinders in the car's engine.
- **Horsepower:** Measure of the engine's power output.
- **MPG_City:** Estimated miles per gallon for city driving conditions.
- **MPG_Highway:** Estimated miles per gallon for highway driving conditions.
- **Weight:** Weight of the vehicle in pounds.
- **Wheelbase:** Distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels (inches).
- **Length:** Overall length of the vehicle (inches).

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and completeness.
